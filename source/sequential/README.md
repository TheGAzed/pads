# SEQUENTIAL DATA STRUCTURES

Sequential data structures are structures where the element can be inserted and removed in a sequence. This category is made up of three data structures.

## List of structures:

- [STACK](https://github.com/TheGAzed/pads/blob/main/source/sequential/stack) : Last in first out (LIFO).
- [QUEUE](https://github.com/TheGAzed/pads/blob/main/source/sequential/queue) : First in first out (FIFO).
- [DEQUE](https://github.com/TheGAzed/pads/blob/main/source/sequential/deque) : Adds and removes only from front and back.
