PADS, short for Preprocessor Abstracted Data Structures, is a personal project that aims to recreate popular data structures for the C programming language. The project includes single header libraries for each structure that use the preprocessor for data type abstraction.

PADS data structures are each divided into at least three modes with support for:

- Infinitely expandable structure via allocated memory
- Finite structure of allocated size
- Finite preprocessor size structure of predefined size

## **List of Data Structures:**

### **Available:**

- [STACK](https://github.com/TheGAzed/pads/blob/main/headers/stack.h)
- [QUEUE](https://github.com/TheGAzed/pads/blob/main/headers/queue.h)

### **In Progress:**

- [BINARY SET](https://github.com/TheGAzed/pads/blob/main/headers/binary_set.h)
- [LIST](https://github.com/TheGAzed/pads/blob/main/headers/list.h)

### **Planned:**

- NARY TREE
- GRAPH
- DIGRAPH
