PADS, short for Preprocessor Abstracted Data Structures, is a personal project that aims to recreate popular data structures for the C programming language. The project includes single header libraries for each structure that use the preprocessor for data type abstraction.

PADS data structures are each divided into at least three modes with support for:

- Infinitely expandable structure via memory reallocation
- Finite structure of variable allocated size
- Finite predefined size array structure using preprocessor

## **List of Data Structures:**
